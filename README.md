# conFIEL Core

conFIEL core is an SDK used to generate KYC-payments peer-to-peer escrow-based payments using the XRP Ledger network. By leveraging `escrowCreate`, a payment can have a custom condition to ensure payment for an item is only released after the payment has been made or the expiration time has passed, given enough time for resolution in case of payment disputes.

*Note: The current version of conFIEL core relies on `Payment` transfers with `Memo` fields for debugging purposes*

### conFIEL ID
KYC-ready payments require a wallet derived from a `.cer` stamped by a CA, and generated by it's self-custodied RSA 2048 private keypair. The key is managed via a PWA called **conFIEL ID** (see https://app.confiel.id) which is able to generate the wallet based on this information. conFIEL ID uses `RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5` signatures over a `pbkdf2` unique secret string to generate a BIP39 seed phrase for our wallet, to avoid using only the RSA private key as a source of entropy.

## Development

**Install dependencies**:

```bash
npm install
```

**Run development server**:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Payment order form page

conFIEL core works mostly by connecting the signatures of buyers and sellers and settle down the escrows. To show this process, we have set up a **Payment Order** proof-of-concept to showcase how conFIEL ID would scan these payments from a buyer.

Once a payment order has been scanned by a conFIEL ID instance, conFIEL ID will notify the user a payment order has been requested. This will allow the connection between the payment order and the user of the wallet looking to execute a transaction.
