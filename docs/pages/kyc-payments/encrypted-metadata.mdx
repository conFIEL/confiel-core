# Encrypted metadata

<p>
  KYC payments contain <b>two</b> important pieces of encrypted metadata: the
  signer information, and the `Fulfillment` data needed to release
  the escrow. These are embedded into a `MemoTag`.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The KYC payment starts as an escrow by submitting an `escrowCreate` transaction. The escrow
  will be a [Timed conditional with expiration
  ](https://xrpl.org/escrowcreate.html), which means that:
</p>

- ✅ The `buyer` can release the payment immediately and within 1-15 days.
- ℹ️ The `seller` can callback the escrow after an unreleased payment from 15-30 days.
- ❗️ The `buyer` can cancel the payment from 30 days onwards.
<br/>
<p>
  To ensure these times are respected, the `escrowCreate` uses a{" "}
  `Condition` field which relies on a `Fulfillment`
  unknown to the `seller`. The `Fulfillment` is stored in two
  formats:
</p>

1. Accessible to the `seller` time-locked for 30 days, and encrypted with its public key.
1. Accessible to the `buyer` encrypted with its public key.
