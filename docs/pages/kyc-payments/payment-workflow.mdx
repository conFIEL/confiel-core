# Payment workflow

<Steps>
### Purchase order created

The `seller` uses the SDK method `order.create`
with the following details: `amount`,
`recipient` (address), `description`,
`public key`. This information is signed with the{" "}
`seller`’s <b>conFIEL wallet</b> to generate a JSON Web
Token (`JWT`) with a QR Code able to be scanned as a
payment order.

### Purchase order scanned

The `buyer` scans an order QR, where they can see the
information for the purchase order. If they accept to acquire the
item, their <b>conFIEL wallet</b> signs the transaction, and generates
the barebones of a `escrowCreate` transaction, alongside a
time-locked encrypted `Fulfillment`, included as{" "}
`MemoData`.

### Escrow Transaction submitted

The `buyer` submits the signed `escrowCreate`
transaction, which can be indexed by the `seller`’s wallet.
Once indexed, the `seller` sees the details of the
transaction and decides to release the item the`buyer`{" "}
bought.

### Escrow Transaction released

Once the `seller` has released the item, the `buyer`
can release the escrow by submitting the `Fulfillment` transaction.
Alternatively, once the time lock has expired, the{" "}
`buyer` can release the escrow themselves within their own <b>conFIEL wallet</b>.
