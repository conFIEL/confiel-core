# Introduction

<p>
  conFIEL core is an SDK used to generate KYC-ready peer-to-peer escrow-based
  payments using the XRP Ledger network. By leveraging
  <code>escrowCreate</code>, a payment can have a custom condition to ensure payment
  for an item is only released after the payment has been made or the expiration
  time has passed, given enough time for resolution in case of payment disputes.
